Hi!

This is my CheckerAI Repo with 2 players. An alpha beta pruning player, and an AI/Sarsa (linear function approximation) player.

An alpha beta pruning player works by simulating a certain number of moves down the game tree, and choosing the move that results in the most amount of reward for that level of foresight.

A SARSA player is a player that learns what the best moves are through learning the weights. Instead of using a Q table, linear function approximation is used.

A front end is in progress!
